# PrissPass
a normal password manager web site.

it will encrypt your passwords and the your master password.

I swear on my favourite key board that i will not have any idea nor anyone else other than you what password has been set as your master password and the other password that you store.
though i will know of what platform 's you have been stored.(I am working on how to encrypt and decrypt this one too. 🙏)
