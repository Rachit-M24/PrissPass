# PrissPass

a normal password manager web site.

it will encrypt your passwords and the your master password.

I swear on my favourite key board that i will not have any idea nor anyone else other than you what password has been set as your master password and the other password that you store.
though i will know of what platform 's you have been stored.
(And as i said i was working on the encryption and decryption of the sitename and other fields of password so it has been done. ðŸ˜Ž)
